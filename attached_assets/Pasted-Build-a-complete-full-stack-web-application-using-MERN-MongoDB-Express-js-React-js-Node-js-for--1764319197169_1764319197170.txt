💥 Overall Goal

Build a complete platform where:

Users create account → login → register events

Hackathon team leader can add members

Admin can manage everything & download CSV

Use MongoDB for database

Nodemailer for emails

Deliver the project with full source code and instructions to run:

/frontend → React

/backend → Node + Express

.env example

Add clean UI and good folder structure.
